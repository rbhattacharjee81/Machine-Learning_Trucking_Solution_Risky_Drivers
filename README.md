# Machine-Learning_Trucking_Solution_Risky_Drivers
Identify top risky commercial truck drivers in United States by understanding the risk involved in their truck movements
Fleet Management and driver compliance:
1. Applied analytical, statistical methods and Big Data Hadoop Ecosystems on truck fleet data to analyze trucking movement. 
2. The goal is to identify top risky commercial truck drivers by understanding the risk involved to prevent 
injuries and deaths in the United States.
3. Used Hive DDL and Pig Script to load data in HDFS. Same data connected with Tableau using Impala ODBC connector. 
4. Using Tableau as a visualization tool, created many insightful reports on drivers based 
on various aspects like Latitude, Longitude, City, events, total miles, average velocity, and Gas 
Consumption.
5. Led team to come up with visualization as top 5 risky drivers, violation distributions, truck model vs risk 
factor distributions, top cities with most security events and risk factor and city wise event bar chart.
Environment: SQL, Tableau, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, Pig, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Quality, Data pre-processing, 
Data normalization.
